# Final Project Progress  

In class, I researched and tried out three different kinds of knots.

The first knot seems to be the winner. The second and third knots started coming undone after playing with them for a bit. I'm going to try undoing the stitching on the four leds and redoing it with the new knot, although I think it would still be helpful to add a bit of the clear nail polish to add some extra security.
